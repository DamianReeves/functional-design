/*
 * INTRODUCTION
 *
 * In Functional Design, a functional domain consists of three things:
 *
 * 1. A set of types that model a solution to a domain problem.
 *
 * 2. Constructors that allow constructing simple solutions.
 *
 * 3. Operators that solving more complex problems by transforming
 *    and combining solutions for subproblems.
 *
 * Functional domains allow modeling solutions to problems in a specific domain.
 * Done properly, a small set of primitives can be so powerful, they can be used
 * compositionally to describe all possible solutions in that domain.
 *
 * A functional domain can be regarded as a type of internal domain-specific
 * language (DSL), which is designed specifically for expressing compositional
 * solutions to some category of domain problems.
 *
 * ZIO is an example of a domain for input/output, whose effect type lets you
 * solve async/concurrent/resourceful problems, and whose operators let you
 * assemble large solutions from small solutions.
 *
 * In this section, you'll learn about designing domains using ADTS,
 * constructors, and composable operators.
